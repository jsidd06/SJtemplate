                    <h2>Describe about Data Base Management system</h2>

                    <h4>
                        What is DBMS used for?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        DBMS commonly mentioned as a management system is an application system whose main purpose
                        revolves around the data. This is a system that permits its user to store the info, define it,
                        retrieve it, and update the knowledge about the info inside the database.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is meant by a Database?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In simple terms, a Database is a collection of data in some organized way to facilitate its
                        user’s to easily access, manage, and upload the data.
                    </p>



                    <h4>
                        Why is the use of DBMS recommended? Explain by listing some of its major advantages?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Some of the most advantages of DBMS are as follows:
                        Controlled Redundancy:- DBMS supports a mechanism to regulate the redundancy of knowledge inside
                        the info base by integrating all the data into one database and as data is stored at only one
                        place, the duplicity of knowledge doesn't happen.
                        Data Sharing:- Sharing of knowledge among multiple users simultaneously also can be wiped out
                        DBMS because the same database is going to be shared among all the users and by different
                        application programs.
                        Backup and Recovery Facility:- DBMS minimizes the pain of making the backup of knowledge again
                        and again by providing a feature of ‘backup and recovery’ which automatically creates the info
                        backup and restores the data whenever required.
                        Enforcement of Integrity Constraints: Integrity Constraints are vital to be enforced on the info
                        so that the refined data after putting some constraints are stored within the database and this
                        is followed by DBMS.
                        Independence of data:- It simply means you'll change the structure of the info without affecting
                        the structure of any of the appliance programs.


                    </p>
                    <h4>What is the purpose of normalization in DBMS?</h4>
                    <p>Normalization is the process of analyzing the relational schemas which are based on their
                        respective functional dependencies and the primary keys to fulfilling certain properties.
                        The properties include:
                        To minimize the redundancy of the data.
                        To minimize the Insert, Delete, and Update Anomalies.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What are the various sorts of languages that are available within the DBMS?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        There are three types of languages in the DBMS as mentioned below:
                        DDL:- DDL is Data Definition Language which is employed to define the database and schema
                        structure by using some set of SQL Queries like CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP, and RENAME.
                        DCL:- DCL is a Data Control Language that is used to control the access of the users inside the
                        database by using some set of SQL Queries like GRANT and REVOKE.
                        DML:- DML is Data Manipulation Language which is employed to try to some manipulations within
                        the database like Insertion, Deletion, etc. by using some set of SQL Queries like SELECT,
                        INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE.

                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is the purpose of SQL?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        SQL stands for Structured command language whose main purpose is to interact with the relational
                        databases within the sort of inserting and updating/modifying the info within the database.

                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Explain the concepts of a Primary key and Foreign Key?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        A Primary Key is used to uniquely identify the records in a database table while Foreign Key is
                        mainly used to link two or more tables together, as this is a particular field(s) in one among
                        the database tables which are the first key of another table.
                        Ex: There are two tables – Employee and Department. Both have one common field/column as ‘ID’
                        where ID is that the primary key of the worker table while this is often the foreign key for the
                        Department table.

                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is the concept of sub-query in terms of SQL?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Sub-query is the query that is included inside some other query and can also be called an inner
                        query which is found inside the outer query.
                        What is the use of the DROP command and what are the differences between DROP, TRUNCATE, and
                        DELETE commands?
                        DROP command may be a DDL command which is employed to drop/delete the prevailing table,
                        database, index, or view from the database.
                    </p>
